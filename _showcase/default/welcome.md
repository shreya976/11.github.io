    <h2>Showcase: My Work & Research</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
        Over the years, I have worked on <strong>diverse projects</strong>, ranging from <strong>COVID-19 prediction, MRI segmentation, large-scale surveys, deep learning applications</strong>, and <strong>statistical modeling</strong>. This space will serve as a <strong>repository of my research, experiments, and insights</strong>, where I will be compiling and sharing the materials I have used in my journey.

        You can create a new showcase item by creating a new file in the <code>_showcase</code> folder. It gives you the highest flexibility to customize the item using any HTML code.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cards are ordered by the <code>date</code> field in the front matter in descending order. The <code>width</code> field is used to determine the width of the card, ranging from 1 to 12.
        Layout is done by the <a href="https://masonry.desandro.com/" target="_blank">Masonry</a> library.
    </p>
    <p>
        For a tidy layout, it is recommended to set the width of the cards to be either multiple of 3 or multiple of 4 for all cards, except for small badges that do not take up much space (width=1).
